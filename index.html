          A little bit about me, I am currently in the process of learning code to become a full stack developer. I am trying to do this without any college, which if
          <br> you know the profession, you know many coders have a computer science degree. I have started my training on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/?utm_source=adwords-brand&utm
          _medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=Brand-Udemy_la.EN_cc.US&utm_term=_._ag_78616515599_._ad_530955630840_._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_kwd-310556426868_._li_9023211_._pd__._&utm_term=_._

          <br> and Bootstrap. We are about to switch to backend development here soon. With the backend development I will be able to learn Node.js, NPM, Express.js, EJS,
          <br> REST, and API's. After that we will move onto Databases where I will learn SQL, MongoDB, and Mongoose. I have also started learning Java 11 and after that I
          <br> will move on to learning spring. I would like to know as much as I can before applying to positions. I plan on updating this site regularly to keep up with
          <br>where I'm at in my learning process and how things are going for me. I will also add things on this site that I struggle with in my learning journey.
